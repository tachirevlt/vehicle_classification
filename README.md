#  Vehicle Classification with CNN

This project implements a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of vehicles into four categories: **Car**, **Bus**, **Truck**, and **Motorcycle**.

---

##  Dataset

The dataset contains labeled images of four vehicle types:
- **Car**
- **Bus**
- **Truck**
- **Motorcycle**


---

##  Model Architecture

We use a custom **CNN architecture** built with PyTorch:

- 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU + MaxPooling
- Fully Connected layer with Dropout
- Softmax output for classification

---

##  Installation

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tachirevlt/vehicle_classification.git
```

## Evaluation

|             | precision |   recall | f1-score | 
|-------------|-----------|----------|----------|
|         Bus |    0.7273 |   0.4706 |   0.5714 |
|         Car |    0.5000 |   0.4118 |   0.4516 |
|  motorcycle |    0.3684 |   0.4375 |   0.4000 |
|       Truck |    0.4375 |   0.7000 |   0.5385 |

- The current model (can be simple CNN) has not learned well for 4 classes.

- Imbalance can be part of the cause â†’ the most truck image, little motorcycle.

- Classes may have a overlapping image (eg bus vs truck).

## Future Improvements

1. Expand the Dataset
- Collect more images across different angles, lighting, occlusions, and backgrounds.

- Focus on underrepresented or confusing classes like Bus and Motorcycle.

2. Upgrade the Model
- Replace the simple CNN with modern architectures such as:
ResNet18, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet

- Apply Transfer Learning for better feature extraction and faster convergence.

3. Filter Out Noisy / Occluded Data
- Implement preprocessing techniques to detect and remove:

- Heavily blurred images

- Objects obscured by other elements (e.g., trees, poles, people)

4.  Focused Cropping
- Use semantic segmentation or object detection (YOLO, Mask R-CNN) to:

- Crop and center the main vehicle region

- This helps the model focus on shape and structure rather than surrounding context.
